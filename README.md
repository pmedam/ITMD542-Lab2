** Project Description – **

The Lab 2 assignment for the ITMD 442/542 course includes this project. 
Using Node.js Express, a contact database application is created. 
Users of the programme may create, read, update, and delete contacts, among other CRUD actions, on an individual basis. 
The programme adheres to RESTful URL patterns and MVC Structure, and the data is stored on a file system.



**Development Environment – **
Node JS Version: v18.18.0
Template Engine: PUG
Editor: VS Code


**Installation/Running Instructions –** 
1. Clone the repository using the above-mentioned Git URL.
2. Use your terminal to go to the project directory.
3. To install dependencies, run npm install.
4. Type npm start to launch the programme.
5. Open the application at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.


**Insights and Results – **
1) Firstly, I'm new to the Front-end frameworks, so had to go through the professor videos to do the assignment.
2) Routing the pug files was bit challenging and bit confusing when compared to other frameworks.
3) Passing of variables data in the router functions and using them on the UI was bit confusing, however learnt it going through videos and online stack overflow websites.
4) Working with the file system, validation of data. However I've learned to use the framework in a basic way, need to increase the knowledge on implementing the whole application end to end.

**References (if needed)–** 
Honestly, I've followed the professor's video and and top of it used stackoverflow to find the rootcauses and implemented in my code.


Below are the screenshots of the successful implementation of the whole project.
